## About
Project Status :baby_symbol:

This is a simple React SPA that I put together over a few hours while studying for exams and an interview. It complements an API by the same name. There are certainly a few areas that need to be refactored and additional functionality should be built in over time.

The API [lives here](https://github.com/vapurrmaid/httplato-api)
